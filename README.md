# Deep-Learning-Tensorflow-Rock-and-Mine-Identifier-MultiLayer-Perceptron

### Naval Mine Identifier
Using the sonar dataset which contains the frequencies that are reflected by the submarien that will be used to classify whether the object is a rock or mine.

Using Tensorflow created a deep neural network for creating and saving the model(checkpoint). The python code file "rockmine.py" contains comments that are easy to understand what every function does.

I have created a multilayer perceptron with 4 hidden layer and 60 neurons each layer that uses gradient descent optimizer to minimize the cost.

The output or the accuracy is as given below.
